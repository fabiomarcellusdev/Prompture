# üß† Clean AI Code ‚Äì Development Rules & AI Collaboration Guide

This document provides comprehensive guidelines for AI-assisted development. You have two options for using this document:

1. **Quick Reference (‚ö°Ô∏è):** Use only the Quick Start Guide section (marked with ‚ö°Ô∏è) for essential, immediate actions. This is recommended when token context is limited (estimated ~500 tokens).
2. **Full Document:** Use the entire document for comprehensive guidance. This is recommended when you have sufficient token context available (estimated ~3,500 tokens).

Choose the appropriate option based on your current token context and needs. The Quick Start Guide provides all essential information for immediate tasks while keeping token usage minimal.

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Quick Start Guide

### Session Setup
1. Review `.ai/active-context.md` for current context, token limit, and active task
2. Set up token tracking for the session
3. Prepare to notify when approaching token limit
4. Do not make architectural or style decisions unless explicitly asked.

### Context Priority
1. `.ai/active-context.md` ‚Äì Current context, token limits, and active task
2. `ai-docs/SRS.md` ‚Äì Technical specification
3. `ai-docs/PRD.md` ‚Äì Product vision
4. `ai-docs/SYSTEM-ARCHITECTURE.md` ‚Äì Architecture

### Task Focus
- Work on one feature/task/subtask per session
- Reference task from `.ai/active-context.md`
- Avoid multiple tasks in one prompt

### Session End
1. Summarize work and decisions
2. Save to `.ai/archived-summaries/MM-DD-YYYY.md`
3. Update `.ai/active-context.md`

## üìú Core Philosophy

1. **Simplicity:** Prioritize simple, clear, and maintainable solutions. Avoid unnecessary complexity or over-engineering.
2. **Iterate:** Prefer iterating on existing, working code rather than building entirely new solutions from scratch, unless fundamentally necessary or explicitly requested.
3. **Focus:** Concentrate efforts on the specific task assigned. Avoid unrelated changes or scope creep.
4. **Quality:** Strive for a clean, organized, well-tested, and secure codebase.
5. **Collaboration:** This document guides both human developers and the AI assistant for effective teamwork.
6. **Requirements-Driven:** All development decisions should align with the requirements specified in `ai-docs/SRS.md` and `ai-docs/PRD.md`.

## üìö Project Context & Understanding

1. **Documentation First:**
   * **Always** check for and thoroughly review relevant project documentation *before* starting any task. This includes in order of priority of information:
     * `.ai/active-context.md` (Current context and active task)
     * Product Requirements Documents (PRDs)
     * `README.md` (Project overview, setup, patterns, technology stack)
     * `ai-docs/SYSTEM-ARCHITECTURE.md` (System architecture, component relationships)
     * `ai-docs/TECHNICAL.md` (Technical specifications, established patterns)
     * `ai-docs/TASKS.md` (Task history and future work)
   * If documentation is missing, unclear, or conflicts with the request, **ask for clarification**.
2. **Architecture Adherence:**
   * Understand and respect module boundaries, data flow, system interfaces, and component dependencies outlined in `ai-docs/SYSTEM-ARCHITECTURE.md`.
   * Validate that changes comply with the established architecture. Warn and propose compliant solutions if a violation is detected.
3. **Pattern & Tech Stack Awareness:**
   * Reference `README.md` and `ai-docs/TECHNICAL.md` to understand and utilize existing patterns and technologies.
   * Exhaust options using existing implementations before proposing new patterns or libraries.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Task Execution & Workflow

1. **Task Definition:**
   * Clearly understand the task requirements, acceptance criteria, and any dependencies from `.ai/active-context.md` and the PRD.
2. **Systematic Change Protocol:** Before making significant changes:
   * **Identify Impact:** Determine affected components, dependencies, and potential side effects.
   * **Plan:** Outline the steps. Tackle one logical change or file at a time.
   * **Verify Testing:** Confirm how the change will be tested. Add tests if necessary *before* implementing (see TDD).
3. **Progress Tracking:**
   * Update `.ai/active-context.md` with task progress and update `ai-docs/TASKS.md` for task history.

## ü§ñ AI Collaboration & Prompting

1. **Clarity is Key:** Provide clear, specific, and unambiguous instructions to the AI. Define the desired outcome, constraints, and context.
2. **Context Referencing:** If a task spans multiple interactions, explicitly remind the AI of relevant previous context, decisions, or code snippets.
3. **Suggest vs. Apply:** Clearly state whether the AI should *suggest* a change for human review or *apply* a change directly (use only when high confidence and task is well-defined). Use prefixes like "Suggestion:" or "Applying fix:".
4. **Question AI Output:** Human developers should critically review AI-generated code. Question assumptions, verify logic, and don't blindly trust confident-sounding but potentially incorrect suggestions (hallucinations).
5. **Focus the AI:** Guide the AI to work on specific, focused parts of the task. Avoid overly broad requests that might lead to architectural or logical errors.
6. **Leverage Strengths:** Use the AI for tasks it excels at (boilerplate generation, refactoring specific patterns, finding syntax errors, generating test cases) but maintain human oversight for complex logic, architecture, and security.
7. **Incremental Interaction:** Break down complex tasks into smaller steps for the AI. Review and confirm each step before proceeding.
8. **Standard Check-in (for AI on large tasks):** Before providing significant code suggestions:
   * "Confirming understanding: I've reviewed [specific document/previous context]. The goal is [task goal], adhering to [key pattern/constraint]. Proceeding with [planned step]."

## ‚ú® Code Quality & Style

1. **Type Guidelines:** Use appropriate typing for your language (e.g., TypeScript strict typing, Python type hints). Document complex logic or public APIs.
2. **Readability & Maintainability:** Write clean, well-organized code.
3. **Small Files & Components:**
   * Keep files under **300 lines**. Refactor proactively.
   * Break down large components/modules into smaller, single-responsibility units.
4. **Avoid Duplication (DRY):** Actively look for and reuse existing functionality. Refactor to eliminate duplication.
5. **Linting/Formatting:** Ensure all code conforms to project's linting and formatting rules.
6. **Pattern Consistency:** Adhere to established project patterns. Don't introduce new ones without discussion/explicit instruction. If replacing an old pattern, ensure the old implementation is fully removed.
7. **File Naming:** Use clear, descriptive names. Avoid "temp", "refactored", "improved", etc., in permanent file names.
8. **No One-Time Scripts:** Do not commit one-time utility scripts into the main codebase.

## ‚ôªÔ∏è Refactoring

1. **Purposeful Refactoring:** Refactor to improve clarity, reduce duplication, simplify complexity, or adhere to architectural goals.
2. **Holistic Check:** When refactoring, look for duplicate code, similar components/files, and opportunities for consolidation across the affected area.
3. **Edit, Don't Copy:** Modify existing files directly. Do not duplicate files and rename them (e.g., `component-v2.tsx`).
4. **Verify Integrations:** After refactoring, ensure all callers, dependencies, and integration points function correctly. Run relevant tests.

## ‚úÖ Testing & Validation

1. **Test-Driven Development (TDD):**
   * **New Features:** Outline tests, write failing tests, implement code, refactor.
   * **Bug Fixes:** Write a test reproducing the bug *before* fixing it.
2. **Comprehensive Tests:** Write thorough unit, integration, and/or end-to-end tests covering critical paths, edge cases, and major functionality.
3. **Tests Must Pass:** All tests **must** pass before committing or considering a task complete. Notify the human developer immediately if tests fail and cannot be easily fixed.
4. **No Mock Data (Except Tests):** Use mock data *only* within test environments. Development and production should use real or realistic data sources.
5. **Manual Verification:** Supplement automated tests with manual checks where appropriate, especially for UI changes.

## üêõ Debugging & Troubleshooting

1. **Fix the Root Cause:** Prioritize fixing the underlying issue causing an error, rather than just masking or handling it, unless a temporary workaround is explicitly agreed upon.
2. **Console/Log Analysis:** Always check browser and server console output for errors, warnings, or relevant logs after making changes or when debugging. Report findings.
3. **Targeted Logging:** For persistent or complex issues, add specific `console.log` statements (or use a project logger) to trace execution and variable states. *Remember to check the output.*
4. **Check the `ai-docs/fixes/` Directory:** Before deep-diving into a complex or recurring bug, check `ai-docs/fixes/` for documented solutions to similar past issues.
5. **Document Complex Fixes:** If a bug requires significant effort (multiple iterations, complex logic) to fix, create a concise `.md` file in the `ai-docs/fixes/` directory detailing the problem, investigation steps, and the solution. Name it descriptively (e.g., `ai-docs/fixes/resolve-race-condition-in-user-update.md`).
6. **Research:** Use available tools (Firecrawl, documentation search, etc.) to research solutions or best practices when stuck or unsure.

## üîí Security

1. **Server-Side Authority:** Keep sensitive logic, validation, and data manipulation strictly on the server-side. Use secure API endpoints.
2. **Input Sanitization/Validation:** Always sanitize and validate user input on the server-side.
3. **Dependency Awareness:** Be mindful of the security implications of adding or updating dependencies.
4. **Credentials:** Never hardcode secrets or credentials in the codebase. Use environment variables or a secure secrets management solution.

## üå≥ Version Control & Environment

1. **Git Hygiene:**
   * Commit frequently with clear, atomic messages.
   * Keep the working directory clean; ensure no unrelated or temporary files are staged or committed.
   * Use `.gitignore` effectively.
2. **Branching Strategy:** Follow the project's established branching strategy. Do not create new branches unless requested or necessary for the workflow (e.g., feature branches).
3. **.env Files:** **Never** commit `.env` files. Use `.env.example` for templates. Do not overwrite local `.env` files without confirmation.
4. **Environment Awareness:** Code should function correctly across different environments (dev, test, prod). Use environment variables for configuration.
5. **Server Management:** Kill related running servers before starting new ones. Restart servers after relevant configuration or backend changes.

## üìÑ Documentation Maintenance

1. **Update Docs:** If code changes impact architecture, technical decisions, established patterns, or task status, update the relevant documentation (`README.md`, `ai-docs/SYSTEM-ARCHITECTURE.md`, `ai-docs/TECHNICAL.md`, `ai-docs/TASKS.md`).
2. **Keep Rules Updated:** This document should be reviewed and updated periodically to reflect learned best practices and project evolution.
